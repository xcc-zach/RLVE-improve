## Bug Reports & Questions

If you have any questions about the code or the paper, feel free to contact [Zhiyuan Zeng](https://zhiyuan-zeng.github.io/) (`zhiyuan1zeng@gmail.com` or `zyzeng@cs.washington.edu`).

If you encounter any issues while using the code or want to report a bug, please open an issue. When reporting a problem, provide detailed information so we can assist you more effectively.

## Setup

Our environment setup is the same as the setup of the official [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) framework. We use Docker:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull slimerl/slime:v0.5.0rc0-cu126

# Start the container
docker run -d --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size=16g \
  --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  --name RLVE \
  slimerl/slime:v0.5.0rc0-cu126 \
  tail -f /dev/null
```

After entering the Docker container, please follow these steps to clone the repository and install it:

```bash
cd /root/
git clone https://github.com/Zhiyuan-Zeng/RLVE.git
cd RLVE
pip install -e .
```

## Usage of Verifiable Environments in RLVE-Gym

Each environment has an identifier, which you can find [here](Gym/environments/__init__.py). We take the following example:

```python
identifier = "Sorting"
```

Each environment has two classes - one for the environment itself and another for controlling the problem difficulty:

```python
from Gym.environments import identifier2environment
from Gym.parameter_controllers import identifier2controller

environment = identifier2environment[identifier]
controller_class = identifier2controller[identifier]
```

Note that when creating the environment, you can specify the argument `answer_markers` to control how the answer is extracted from a model’s output during verification.
By default, it extracts the answer enclosed between `<answer>` and `</answer>`.
You can check [this example usage](slime/rollout/rm_hub/rlve_rm.py) for reference.

When generating a problem, we specify a random seed `seed` and a problem difficulty level `d` ($d \geq 0$):

```python
import random

seed = 42

controller = controller_class()
d = 3
for _ in range(d) :
    controller.update()

problem = environment()
parameter = random.choice(controller.get_parameter_list())
if problem.generator(seed = seed, parameter = parameter) :
    pass
else :
    problem = None
```

Problem generation is successful when `problem` is not `None`.

The input prompt is obtained via `problem.prompt_generator()`.  
The reward for a model output `output` is given by `problem.scorer(output)`, or you can access more detailed verification information using `problem.verifier(output)`.

You can check [here](Gym/environment.py) for more detailed usage.

## Model Download & Weight Conversion

In the following, we assume you are on a node with 8 GPUs, each equipped with at least 80GB of memory.
We recommend using H100 or H200 GPUs over A100s, due to recent findings regarding floating-point precision issues observed on A100 hardware.

We download models from Hugging Face and convert their weights from the Hugging Face format to the Megatron format:

```bash
# Qwen2.5-7B-Base
hf download Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B --local-dir ../Qwen2.5-7B
source scripts/models/qwen2.5-7B.sh
PYTHONPATH=/root/Megatron-LM python tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py \
    ${MODEL_ARGS[@]} \
    --hf-checkpoint ../Qwen2.5-7B \
    --save ../Qwen2.5-7B_torch_dist

# R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
hf download deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B --local-dir ../DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
source scripts/models/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-1.5B.sh
PYTHONPATH=/root/Megatron-LM python tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py \
    ${MODEL_ARGS[@]} \
    --hf-checkpoint ../DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B \
    --save ../DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B_torch_dist

# DeepScaleR-1.5B
hf download agentica-org/DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview --local-dir ../DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview
source scripts/models/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-1.5B.sh
PYTHONPATH=/root/Megatron-LM python tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py \
    ${MODEL_ARGS[@]} \
    --hf-checkpoint ../DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview \
    --save ../DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview_torch_dist

# ProRL-1.5B-v2
hf download nvidia/Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B --revision v2 --local-dir ../Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B-v2
source scripts/models/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-1.5B.sh
PYTHONPATH=/root/Megatron-LM python tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py \
    ${MODEL_ARGS[@]} \
    --hf-checkpoint ../Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B-v2 \
    --save ../Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B-v2_torch_dist

# OpenThinker3-1.5B
hf download open-thoughts/OpenThinker3-1.5B --local-dir ../OpenThinker3-1.5B
source scripts/models/qwen2.5-1.5B.sh
PYTHONPATH=/root/Megatron-LM python tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py \
    ${MODEL_ARGS[@]} \
    --hf-checkpoint ../OpenThinker3-1.5B \
    --save ../OpenThinker3-1.5B_torch_dist
```

**Warning:** Please make sure the weight conversion is successful before starting any training.
Even if the conversion fails, training can still launch without a runtime error, but the model will be trained from randomly initialized weights.


## Reward Shaping

By default, we use the original reward provided by each verifiable environment as the reward used in the RL algorithm.  
Many environments employ continuous reward shaping, meaning that a model output can still receive a positive reward even if its answer is not fully correct.  
We found that when the training scale is small, using a binary reward can sometimes yield slightly better results (i.e., the model output receives 1 if and only if its answer is fully correct, and 0 otherwise).  
You can switch to binary rewards by changing `--reward-key reward` to `--reward-key accuracy` in `scripts/training/[MODEL]/rlve.sh`.

## Wandb Setup

To use Weights & Biases (wandb), please set your wandb API key in the environment variable `WANDB_API_KEY`.  
Alternatively, you can comment out the wandb-related arguments in `WANDB_ARGS` within the training script to disable wandb.

## Environment Scaling

You can run our environment scaling experiments as follows:

```bash
# Qwen2.5-7B-Base
bash scripts/training/Qwen2.5-7B/rlve/num-environment=1.sh RLVE
bash scripts/training/Qwen2.5-7B/rlve/num-environment=4.sh RLVE
bash scripts/training/Qwen2.5-7B/rlve/num-environment=16.sh RLVE
bash scripts/training/Qwen2.5-7B/rlve/num-environment=256.sh RLVE

# R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
bash scripts/training/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/rlve/num-environment=1.sh RLVE
bash scripts/training/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/rlve/num-environment=4.sh RLVE

bash scripts/training/Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B-v2/rlve/num-environment=256.sh RLVE
```

You can use `scripts/evaluation/[MODEL]/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh` to evaluate a checkpoint on the test set built from the 50 held-out environments. For example:

```bash
# Qwen2.5-7B-Base
bash scripts/evaluation/Qwen2.5-7B/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh "../Qwen2.5-7B"
bash scripts/evaluation/Qwen2.5-7B/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh "../[Qwen2.5-7B]_[num-environment=256]/iter_0000016"

# R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
bash scripts/evaluation/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh "../DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B"
bash scripts/evaluation/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh "../[DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B]_[num-environment=256]/iter_0000016"

# DeepScaleR-1.5B
bash scripts/evaluation/DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh "../DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview"
bash scripts/evaluation/DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh "../[DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview]_[num-environment=256]/iter_0000016"

# ProRL-1.5B-v2
bash scripts/evaluation/Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B-v2/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh "../Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B-v2"
bash scripts/evaluation/Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B-v2/eval_HELD-OUT_ENVIRONMENTS.sh "../[Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B-v2]_[num-environment=256]/iter_0000016"
```

## RLVE on Tinker
First run `cd tinker-cookbook` to enter the directory, and then check out the [README](tinker-cookbook/tinker_cookbook/recipes/rlve/README.md) for details on installation and usage of RLVE recipe.

**This Tinker-based implementation also shows how RLVE can be incorporated without changes to the main training loop of your RL framework.**
